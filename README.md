# Quadratic Diplomacy

Quadratic Diplomacy is an attempt by the Moonshot Collective to address DAO contributor compensation by utilizing quadratically-weighed votes for rewarded elections.

Voters receive certain allocation of votes, which they distribute amongst their peers on a _ballot_ to signal their perceived contribution score. Each _candidate_(peer) score is calculated as the cumlative sum of the square root of the votes recieved. e.g. if you put one vote to a candidate, that is counted as one vote; four votes are counted as two votes, and so on, per cast ballot.
